# BTC-Test-Task

## Morning!

If, by some miracle, you've found this branch, I'm very glad! üòç

This is one of my initial experiences with Git, so I encountered a few problems with commits and branches. üëâüëà

Furthermore, I've made updates to the Dockerfile here, and it functions as intended. 

If you could evaluate this work instead of the one on the master branch, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I genuinely put in effort to create a functional application, and I would like you to assess it accurately.üòä
